# surfs_up
This exercise is designed to test skills in Advanced Database techniques using jupyter notebook, numpy, pandas & sqlalchemy.

## Overview of the statistical analysis:


The purpose of the analysis demonstrated in this exercise's code is to review the recorded temperatures for June and December 2010-2017, with the goal of determining whether or not it is sustainable to operate a particular surf shop throughout the entire calendar year. Two separate queries were used to capture a snapshot of (some of) the coldest and warmest months of the Northern hemisphere (e.g. December and June). With the queries run, the temperatures are stored in a list and converted to a dataframe. With the dataframe created, the summary statistics are derived using the df.describe() function. The results are (arguably) ASTOUNDING!

## Results:

June 2010-2017 had an Mean temperature of 74.9°, Max temperature of 85.0° and a Min temperature of 64° degrees! WOWWWY WOW THAT IS HOT!

December 2010-2017 had  a Mean temperature of 71.0°, Max temperature of 83.0° abnd a Min temperature of 56.0°! BRRRRRR!

## Summary:

There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December. (5 pt)
